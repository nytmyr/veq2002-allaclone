	This server is unlocked up to the Planes of Power, level 65.<br>
	<br>
	It is an era-accurate server based of the P2002 Database with a twist.<br>
	<br>
	Do you miss the nostalgia of EQ? Having to work for things, feeling the accomplishment of leveling, growing your character, conquering new content and finding new items and spells?<br>
	<br>
	Well, then you\'ve come to the right place. VegasEQ is all about reliving your favorite times and experiencing of EverQuest 
	without the endless grind and hundreds, if not thousands of hours needed to spend grinding and gearing.<br>
	<br>
	Here you will still have to work for levels, conquering content and fight strategically, but you can forget about that endless grind. 
	This is a more balanced version of The Planes of Power era for those of us who don\'t have 8-hours a day to throw at the game.<br>
	<br>
	You can play solo, with friends, or 2-Box and enjoy advanced bots that accompany you along the way. 
	Bots have had a complete AI rework and are extremely customizable and are far better than you could ever imagine.<br>
	<br>
	Bots unlock as you level and you can unlock more by killing raid targets as you progress. 
	Visit the <a href="?a=bot_info">Bot Information</a> on the sidebar to learn more about bots and their commands.<br>
